## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building an intelligent PDF processing system that extracts structured outlines from PDF documents. The system must identify document titles and hierarchical headings (H1, H2, H3) with their corresponding page numbers, outputting the results in a structured JSON format. The solution must be containerized, run efficiently on CPU-only environments, and handle multilingual documents within strict performance constraints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: PDF Document Processing

**User Story:** As a document analyst, I want to process PDF files up to 50 pages, so that I can extract structured information efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF file is provided as input THEN the system SHALL process documents up to 50 pages
2. WHEN processing a PDF THEN the system SHALL extract text content while preserving formatting information
3. WHEN encountering multilingual content THEN the system SHALL handle text in multiple languages
4. IF a PDF is corrupted or unreadable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling
5. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL generate output within 10 seconds

### Requirement 2: Document Structure Identification

**User Story:** As a content organizer, I want to identify document titles and hierarchical headings, so that I can understand the document's structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing document text THEN the system SHALL identify the main document title
2. WHEN processing headings THEN the system SHALL classify text as H1, H2, or H3 levels
3. WHEN identifying headings THEN the system SHALL determine the correct hierarchical level based on formatting and context
4. WHEN extracting headings THEN the system SHALL capture the exact page number where each heading appears
5. IF no clear title is found THEN the system SHALL use the first significant heading or document name
6. WHEN processing different document types THEN the system SHALL adapt to various formatting styles

### Requirement 3: JSON Output Generation

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want structured JSON output, so that I can easily consume the extracted data in downstream applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL generate JSON output with title and outline structure
2. WHEN creating outline entries THEN the system SHALL include level, text, and page number for each heading
3. WHEN outputting JSON THEN the system SHALL follow the specified format exactly
4. WHEN saving output THEN the system SHALL write to the designated output directory
5. IF extraction fails THEN the system SHALL generate valid JSON with error information

### Requirement 4: Docker Containerization

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want a containerized solution, so that I can run the system consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the container THEN the system SHALL use AMD64 architecture
2. WHEN running THEN the system SHALL operate without GPU requirements (CPU only)
3. WHEN containerized THEN the system SHALL include all dependencies and models
4. WHEN executed THEN the system SHALL run without internet access
5. WHEN built THEN the container SHALL have models under 200MB total size
6. WHEN running THEN the system SHALL mount input and output directories correctly

### Requirement 5: Performance and Resource Constraints

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want efficient resource usage, so that the system can run within specified hardware constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a 50-page PDF THEN the system SHALL complete within 10 seconds
2. WHEN loaded THEN the ML models SHALL not exceed 200MB in total size
3. WHEN running THEN the system SHALL operate efficiently on 8 CPUs and 16GB RAM
4. WHEN processing THEN the system SHALL use CPU-only inference
5. IF processing takes longer than 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL timeout gracefully

### Requirement 6: Accuracy and Quality

**User Story:** As a content analyst, I want accurate heading detection, so that I can rely on the extracted structure for further analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN detecting headings THEN the system SHALL achieve high accuracy in classification
2. WHEN identifying hierarchy THEN the system SHALL correctly determine heading levels
3. WHEN processing multilingual documents THEN the system SHALL maintain accuracy across languages
4. WHEN encountering edge cases THEN the system SHALL handle unusual formatting gracefully
5. WHEN validating output THEN the system SHALL ensure all extracted headings are meaningful and relevant
