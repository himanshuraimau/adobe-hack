# Persona-Driven Document Intelligence - Approach Explanation

## Methodology Overview

Our solution implements a semantic similarity-based approach to extract and rank document sections according to persona-specific requirements. The system combines modern NLP techniques with efficient document processing to deliver contextually relevant content.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
We use PyMuPDF for robust PDF text extraction, implementing intelligent section identification through font analysis and layout heuristics. The system identifies headers by analyzing font size, weight, and formatting patterns, then groups content into logical sections with proper attribution to source documents and page numbers.

### 2. Semantic Understanding
The heart of our approach leverages the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 sentence transformer model (90MB) for semantic embeddings. We create a unified query representation by combining the persona role and job-to-be-done task, then generate embeddings for all document sections. This enables semantic similarity matching rather than simple keyword matching.

### 3. Relevance Ranking
Section relevance is determined through cosine similarity between the query embedding and section embeddings. We rank all sections by similarity score, ensuring the most contextually relevant content appears first. This approach naturally handles diverse domains and personas without manual rule engineering.

### 4. Granular Analysis
For the top-ranked sections (5-10), we perform sentence-level analysis to extract the most relevant content. Each section is split into sentences, embedded individually, and ranked by similarity to the query. The top sentences are then combined to create refined, focused text that directly addresses the persona's needs.

## Technical Optimizations

### Memory Efficiency
We implement batch processing for both PDF parsing and embedding generation to handle large document collections within memory constraints. PDFs are processed in batches of 5, while embeddings are generated in batches of 32 sections.

### Performance
The system is optimized for CPU-only execution with thread limiting and efficient resource management. Processing typically completes in under 60 seconds for 3-5 documents, meeting the performance requirements.

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling ensures robust operation across diverse document types, handling corrupted PDFs, missing files, and processing failures gracefully while continuing with available content.

## Scoring Optimization

Our approach directly addresses the scoring criteria:

**Section Relevance (60 points)**: Semantic similarity ensures sections are ranked by actual relevance to the persona and task, not just keyword presence. The ranking is mathematically grounded in embedding similarity scores.

**Sub-Section Relevance (40 points)**: Sentence-level analysis within top sections provides granular extraction of the most relevant content, creating focused summaries that directly address the specific job-to-be-done.

This methodology provides a generic, scalable solution that adapts to any domain, persona, or task without manual configuration, making it suitable for the diverse test cases outlined in the challenge.
